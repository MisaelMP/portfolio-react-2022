				Mexican-Australian Front End Web Developer with a background as an Art Director, Curator, and Artist. I've always been passionate about technology and its philosophical implications. When I started programming, I quickly discovered two of my main predilections in one spot: logic and creativity. With over six years of experience in both creative and functional programming, I bring a unique approach that bridges UX design and development. 
        In addition, I co-founded and directed an art gallery for four years, where I managed diverse teams
				and the organization as a whole, honing my soft skills. One of my intrinsic qualities is an insatiable drive for knowledge, which constantly pushes me to learn new technologies and experiment with them.
