				Misael M. is a Mexican-Australian Full- Stack Web Developer with a background as an Art Director, Curator,
				Artist, Cacti Collector, Tavern Philosopher, aspiring Creative Programmer and of course... a good citizen. By
				working alongside, interacting and producing technological artworks myself and with many other artists, I learnt
				the importance of functionality and logistics which I now apply to my programming projects. For the last few
				years, I have dabbled in the world of programming, creative and functional, which I try to implement in my
				projects where possible.
